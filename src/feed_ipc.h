// dlss5-feed IPC: the 32-bit in-game add-on <-> 64-bit host protocol.
//
// Everything heavy stays on the GPU. WHICH SIDE CREATES the four shared textures
// depends on the game's API, and the driver decides, not us:
//
//  * D3D11 client (client_kind = FEED_CLIENT_D3D11, protocol v1's only case): the
//    game creates them on D3D11 -- the direction the driver accepts, see the
//    phase-0 spike -- and sends its local NT-handle values; the host duplicates
//    them out of the game process and opens them on D3D12.
//  * OpenGL client (client_kind = FEED_CLIENT_GL) and Vulkan client
//    (FEED_CLIENT_VULKAN): the HOST creates them on D3D12 and duplicates the
//    handles INTO the game, which imports them as GL textures / VkImages. For GL
//    the direction is forced -- GL memory objects are import-only, so a GL process
//    cannot export one (PLAN-OPENGL §5, design A). For Vulkan it is forced the
//    other way round: D3D12 cannot open Vulkan-exported memory. Either way it is
//    the better direction, since the resource is then born with exactly the D3D12
//    flags NGX wants.
//
// Either way the host creates the two shared fences on D3D12 and duplicates them
// INTO the game process. The pipe carries only these fixed-size structs.
//
// Sync per frame n: the host always waits in_fence >= n, evaluates, Signal(out_fence, n).
// The game has two shapes for its half, chosen by its async_home setting:
//
//  * same frame (async_home=0): copy inputs, Signal(in_fence, n), send FeedFrameMsg,
//    record Wait(out_fence, n) + blit. The frame cannot be presented until the host
//    has finished it, so the game's frame time carries the whole round trip.
//  * pipelined (async_home=1, the default): record Wait(out_fence, m) for the frame m
//    sent previously, copy inputs, blit the output the host produced for m, THEN
//    Signal(in_fence, n) and send FeedFrameMsg. The blit reads Output before the
//    signal that lets the host overwrite it, so one shared Output slot stays
//    race-free; the cost is that the DLSS result is one frame old.
//
// Either way it is the same protocol -- the host cannot tell, and does not care.
// A pipe break on either side means "stop feeding".
//
// Version 2 added client_kind and the host-created texture handles. Version 3 added
// FEED_CLIENT_VULKAN and FeedBuildAck::output_fmt -- when the host creates the
// textures it also OWNS the output-format choice (the typed-UAV-store fallback needs
// a D3D12 device to ask), and the game must know the real format to import the
// VkImage and to decide copy-vs-blit for the way home. Version 4 added
// FeedHello::self_process so the host no longer OpenProcess()es the game, which a
// protective DACL on the game process denies (error 5 -- the vanilla-WoW report).
// Version 5 added FeedBuild::client_flags: a D3D11 client whose device refuses the
// shared textures (a feature-level 10.x game, NFS Most Wanted 2012 / issue #33: it
// cannot bind a UAV, and the DLSS output needs one) asks the host to create the set
// instead, exactly as GL/Vulkan clients always have, and to keep the UAV on its own
// side (the host evaluates into a private scratch and copies into the shared Output).
// Version 6 added FeedBuild::target_width/height and FeedFrameMsg::jitter_x/y for
// work_upscale=2 (issue #34): the game asks for a DLSS Super Resolution feature whose
// output is the native size while the guides stay at the work size, and reports the
// sub-pixel shift it applied to the downsample grid on every frame. The host answers
// with FeedBuildAck::flags -- FEED_ACK_SR_UNAVAILABLE when no DLSS quality preset covers
// the ratio, so the game rebuilds as plain DLAA -- and the preset it picked.
// Version 7 added the panel texture: a shared copy of the host's own presented frame (its
// ReShade overlay = the neural consumer's tuning panel), so the game can draw that panel
// itself where the desktop compositor cannot (exclusive fullscreen). FeedHelloAck::panel_*
// says how big the host's frame is; a D3D11 client creates a texture of that size on its
// own device -- the direction this driver accepts, a D3D12-created one comes back
// E_INVALIDARG from OpenSharedResource1 -- and sends its handle in FeedBuild::panel_tex.
// GL and Vulkan clients cannot export a texture the host could open, so for them the host
// creates the panel and hands it over in FeedBuildAck::panel_tex, like their four slots.
// The host copies its back buffer into it after every Present; the game samples it,
// unfenced, as a UI layer.
//
// Both sides refuse a version they do not understand rather than misparsing it: the
// struct sizes differ between versions, so a mismatched pair would desync the pipe.
